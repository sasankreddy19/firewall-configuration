## Summary: How Windows Defender Firewall Filters Traffic

Windows Defender Firewall on Windows 11 filters network traffic by evaluating packets against predefined rules to determine whether to allow or block them. The process works as follows:

- **Rules-Based Filtering**: 
  - Rules define criteria such as:
    - **Port**: E.g., port 23 (Telnet) or 22 (SSH).
    - **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, or others.
    - **Direction**: Inbound (incoming) or Outbound (outgoing).
    - **Action**: Allow (permit traffic) or Block (drop traffic).
  - Example: A rule blocking TCP port 23 drops all inbound Telnet traffic.

- **Packet Inspection**:
  - The firewall examines packet headers, including source/destination IP, port, and protocol.
  - As a stateful firewall, it tracks connection states (e.g., "established" or "new"), allowing responses to outbound requests while blocking unsolicited inbound traffic.

- **Rule Priority**:
  - Rules are evaluated based on specificity, with more specific rules (e.g., port-specific) taking precedence over general ones.
  - Once a packet matches a rule, the specified action is applied, and further rules are ignored.

- **Default Behavior**:
  - By default, Windows Defender Firewall blocks all inbound traffic unless explicitly allowed by a rule, ensuring a secure baseline.
  - Outbound traffic is generally allowed unless a block rule is defined.

- **Security Impact**:
  - Blocking vulnerable ports like 23 (Telnet) prevents attacks, as Telnet is unencrypted and risky.
  - Allowing specific ports, such as 22 for SSH (if configured), enables necessary services while maintaining controlled access.

This filtering mechanism protects the system by enforcing security policies, balancing accessibility and protection.
